# Fuel Management System

The **Fuel Management System** is to streamline fuel requests and approvals for efficient operations. This system allows users to submit fuel requests, admins to manage approvals for requests exceeding predefined thresholds, and tracks all actions in real-time via an activity log.

## Features

### üöó Submit Requests

- Users can submit fuel requests by providing:
  - Driver name
  - Car plate number
  - Requested fuel amount
  - Business name
  - Location
- Requests are handled based on their fuel amount:
  - **Requests under 200 shekels** are auto-approved and logged directly in the activity log.
  - **Requests over 200 shekels** require admin approval and appear in the admin dashboard for further action.

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Dashboard

- Admins have access to a dedicated dashboard to:
  - Approve or reject fuel requests exceeding 200 shekels.
  - View and manage rejected requests in a separate list.

### üìã Activity Log

- A centralized page for tracking all actions related to fuel requests:
  - Displays details of approved and completed requests, including:
    - Driver name
    - Car plate number
    - Fuel amount
    - Business name
    - Location
    - Status (auto-approved/admin-approved)

## How It Works

   - Automatically approved without admin intervention.
   - Directly added to the activity log.

2. **Requests >200 Shekels**:

   - Appear in the admin dashboard for review.
   - Admins can either approve or reject these requests.

3. **Admin Actions**:

   - Rejected requests are moved to a separate rejected list in the admin dashboard.
